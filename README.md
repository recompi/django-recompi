# Django RecomPI

*Django RecomPI* is a Django model mixin that integrates functionalities of RecomPI (Recommender System API) with Django models, enabling easy recommendation and tracking capabilities within Django applications.

## Installation

You can install *Django RecomPI* via pip. Here's how:

```bash
pip install django-recompi
```

## Usage

### Setting up a Django model with RecomPI integration

1. **Define your Django model** (e.g., `Product`) and use `RecomPIModelMixin` as a mixin.

```python
from django.db import models
from django_recompi.models import RecomPIModelMixin

class Product(models.Model, RecomPIModelMixin):
    RECOMPI_DATA_FIELDS = [
        "name",
        "reviews__comment",
        "reviews__rating",
        "reviews__counter.count",
    ]
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100, db_index=True)
    description = models.TextField()

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name
```

2. **Define related models** such as `Review` and `ReviewCounter` with appropriate fields.

```python
from django.db import models

class Review(models.Model):
    product = models.ForeignKey(Product, related_name="reviews", on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    comment = models.CharField(max_length=200, db_index=True)
    rating = models.CharField(choices=RatingChoices.choices, max_length=1, db_index=True)
    counter = models.ForeignKey("ReviewCounter", related_name="reviews", on_delete=models.CASCADE, default=None, null=True, blank=True)

    def __str__(self):
        return f"Review of {self.product.name} - {self.rating}"

class ReviewCounter(models.Model):
    count = models.IntegerField(default=0)
```

### Tracking interactions

```python
# Track user interaction with a product
product = Product.objects.first()
product.recompi_track(
    "product-view",
    ["user_profile_id"],
    "https://www.example.com/products/1",
)
```

### Getting recommendations

```python
# Get product recommendations for a user
recommendations = Product.recompi_recommend(
    "product-view",
    profiles=["user_profile_id"],
)

# Example of printing recommendations
print([{"name": p.name, "recommedation-rank": getattr(p, 'recompi_rank', None)} for p in recommendations.get("product-view", [])])
```

## Settings Configuration

*Django RecomPI* can be customized through the following settings in your `settings.py` file:

### `RECOMPI_API_KEY`

- **Type:** `str`
- **Description:** API key for accessing the RecomPI service. Required for integration.

### `RECOMPI_SECURE_API`

- **Type:** `bool`
- **Default:** `True`
- **Description:** Flag indicating whether to use secure API connections.

### `RECOMPI_SECURE_PROFILE_HASH_SALT`

- **Type:** `str` or `None`
- **Description:** Salt used to hash profile information securely. Profiles hashed with this salt before sending data to RecomPI servers using `SecureProfile`.

### `RECOMPI_SET_RANK_ON_RECORD`

- **Type:** `bool`
- **Default:** `True`
- **Description:** Flag indicating whether to set the recommendation rank on records.

## Error Handling and Exceptions

When using *Django RecomPI*, you may encounter the following exceptions:

- **`RecomPIException`**: Raised when essential settings are not properly configured or when errors occur during API interactions. Handle these exceptions to provide appropriate feedback or logging.

## Security Considerations

Ensure the following security best practices when using *Django RecomPI*:

- **Secure API Key Handling**: Keep `RECOMPI_API_KEY` secure and avoid exposing it in version control or public repositories.
- **Data Encryption**: Use HTTPS (`RECOMPI_SECURE_API`) to encrypt data transmitted between your Django application and the RecomPI service.
- **Secure Profile Hashing**: Utilize `RECOMPI_SECURE_PROFILE_HASH_SALT` to hash profile IDs before sending them to RecomPI servers. This helps protect user data by obscuring identifiable information during transmission.
